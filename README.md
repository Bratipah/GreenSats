## 📌 Overview

GreenSats is a revolutionary platform that transforms environmental actions into instant Bitcoin rewards using the Lightning Network. We're building Africa's first self-sustaining circular economy where recycling, solar energy sharing, and tree planting become profitable activities for local communities.

## 🌍 The Problem We Solve

Africa faces three critical environmental challenges:

1. **Waste Crisis**: <90% recycling rates due to lack of incentives
2. **Energy Poverty**: 600M+ without reliable electricity
3. **Deforestation**: 4M hectares lost annually

Traditional solutions fail because they're:
- Dependent on donor funding
- Burdened by high mobile money fees
- Plagued by corruption in carbon markets

## ⚡ Our Solution

### Three Interconnected Programs:

1. **♻️ Recycle-to-Earn**
   - Instant Lightning payments for plastic/ewaste
   - Smart kiosks with QR code scanners
   - Transparent supply chain tracking

2. **☀️ Solar-to-Earn**
   - P2P energy trading via Lightning
   - Bitcoin miners as anchor buyers
   - LN-enabled smart meters ($50/unit)

3. **🌳 Plant-to-Earn**
   - Geotagged tree verification
   - RGB-based carbon credits
   - Corporate sponsorship portal
